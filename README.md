# Linear Regression

## Overview

Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used for predictive modeling and analysis. The goal is to find the linear relationship that best fits the data, represented by the equation:

\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n \]

where \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept, \( \beta_i \) are the coefficients (weights), and \( x_i \) are the independent variables.

## Features

- **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression**: Support for both simple and multiple linear regression.
- **Model Evaluation**: Built-in metrics for evaluating the performance of the model.
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize the regression line and data points.
- **Experimentation**: Includes an experiment to demonstrate the effect of noise on data and what that effect in weights.
